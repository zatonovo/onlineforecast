In many practical applications, there is a natural upper bound that truncates the probability tail. This article derives estimators for the truncated Pareto distribution, investigates their properties, and illustrates a way to check for fit. These methods are illustrated with applications from finance, hydrology, and atmospheric science. },

Estimations of monthly average hourly global radiation from daily summations are discussed. It was observed that Collares-Pereira and Rabl model as modified by Gueymard (CPRG) yielded the best performance for estimating mean hourly global radiation incident on a horizontal surface for Indian regions. Estimations of monthly average hourly beam and diffuse radiation are discussed. It was observed that Singh-Tiwari and Jamil-Tiwari both models generally give better results for climatic conditions of Indian regions. Therefore, their use is recommended for composite climate of Indian regions. Empirical correlations developed to establish a relationship between the hourly diffuse fraction and the hourly clearness index using hourly global and diffuse irradiation measurements on a horizontal surface are discussed. Fifty models using the Angstrom-Prescott equation to predict the average daily global radiation with hours of sunshine are considered.

A numerical model, based on the finite-volume method and using the implicit formulation, is developed and applied for six variants of a typical roof structure used in the construction of buildings in Saudi Arabia. The climatic conditions of the city of Riyadh are employed for representative days for July and January. The study gives the detailed temperature and heat flux variations with time and the relative importance of the various heat-transfer components as well as the daily averaged roof heat-transfer load, dynamic R-values and the radiative heat-transfer coefficient. The results show that the inclusion of a 5-cm thick molded polystyrene layer reduces the roof heat-transfer load to one-third of its value in an identical roof section without insulation. Using a polyurethane layer instead, reduces the load to less than one-quarter. A slightly better thermal performance is achieved by locating the insulation layer closer to the inside surface of the roof structure but this exposes the water proofing membrane layer to larger temperature fluctuations.

This paper outlines a method for fitting recordings of presence of occupants and simulation of single-person to multiple-persons office environments. The method includes modeling of dependence on time of day, and by use of a filter of the observations it is able to capture per-employee sequence dynamics. Simulations using this method are compared with simulations using homogeneous Markov chains and show far better ability to reproduce key properties of the data. The method is based on inhomogeneous Markov chains with where the transition probabilities are estimated using generalized linear models with polynomials, B-splines, and a filter of passed observations as inputs. For treating the dispersion of the data series, a hierarchical model structure is used where one model is for low presence rate, and another is for high presence rate. },

  Abstract                 = {The share of the global power production coming from solar power is increasing. Forecasts of solar power is a key point for a successful integration of the solar power production into the existing electricity grid. In the present thesis a solar power forecasting method is developed. The overall production of 21 grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems with peak power in the range of 1 kWp to 4 kWp is used. The PV systems are located within an area of a few square kilometers. Numerical weather predictions (NWP) of global irradiation from the mesoscale NWP model DMI-Hirlam, is also used as input to the method. A clear sky model only based on solar power observations is developed. It is used to transform the solar power process into a stationary process that resembles the transmittance of the atmosphere. This process is modeled with linear models and the best model both with and without NWPs as input is identi¯ed. Adaptive estimation is found to be a requisite. Therefore the prediction models of the transformed solar power process are fitted using k-step recursive least squares with forgetting. The evaluation focus on solar power forecasts for the purpose of bidding into the electricity market Elspot. The forecasts are issued at 12:00 UTC each day and consist of hour value predictions up to a 36 hour horizon of solar power. These forecasts are evaluated and compared to a persistence reference model. The achieved results clearly indicate an increasing performance for next day horizons (12 to 36 hours), by the model using NWPs as input. Whereas for very short-term predictions (less than 6 hours) the solar power observations are the most important input. Finally ideas for both refinements and extensions to the method are outlined, together with a suggestion for the development of a framework for standardization of solar power forecasting method evaluation.},

The models can be used for different purposes, e.g. control of the indoor climate, forecasting of energy consumption, and for accurate description of energy performance of the building. Grey-box models based on prior physical knowledge and data-driven modelling are applied. This facilitates insight into otherwise hidden information about the physical properties of the building. A hierarchy of models of increasing complexity is formulated based on prior physical knowledge and a forward selection strategy is suggested enabling the modeller to iteratively select suitable models of increasing complexity. The performance of the models is compared using likelihood ratio tests, and they are validated using a combination of appropriate statistics and physical interpretation of the results. A case study is described in which a suitable model is sought after for a single storey 120m2 building. The result is a set of different models of increasing complexity, with which building characteristics, such as: thermal conductivity, heat capacity of different parts, and window area, are estimated.},

The forecasting model is built using data from sixteen houses located in Sønderborg, Denmark, combined with local climate measurements and weather forecasts. Every hour the hourly heat load for each house the following two days is forecasted. The forecast models are adaptive linear time-series models and the climate inputs used are: ambient temperature, global radiation and wind speed. A computationally efficient recursive least squares scheme is used. The models are optimized to fit the individual characteristics for each house, such as the level of adaptivity and the thermal dynamical response of the building, which is modeled with simple transfer functions. Identification of a model, which is suitable for all the houses, is carried out. The results show that the one-step ahead errors are close to white noise and that practically all correlation to the climate variables are removed. Furthermore, the results show that the forecasting errors mainly are related to: unpredictable high frequency variations in the heat load signal (predominant only for some houses), shifts in resident behavior patterns and uncertainty of the weather forecasts for longer horizons, especially for solar radiation. },

  abstract  = {This paper describes a new approach to online forecasting of power output from solar thermal collectors. The method is suited for online forecasting in many applications and in this paper it is applied to predict hourly values of power from a standard single glazed large area flat plate collector. The method is applied for horizons of up to 42 hours. Solar heating systems naturally come with a hot water tank, which can be utilized for energy storage also for other energy sources. Thereby such systems can become an important part of energy systems with a large share of uncontrollable energy sources, such as wind power. In such a scenario online forecasting is a vital tool for optimal control and utilization of solar heating systems. The method is a two-step scheme, where first a non-linear model is applied to transform the solar power into a stationary process, which then is forecasted with robust time-adaptive linear models. The approach is similar to the one by Bacher et al. (2009), but contains additional effects due to differences between solar thermal collectors and photovoltaics. Numerical weather predictions provided by Danish Meteorological Institute are used as input. The applied models adapt over time enabling tracking of changes in the system and in the surrounding conditions, such as decreasing performance due to wear and dirt, and seasonal changes such as leaves on trees. This furthermore facilitates remote monitoring and check of the system.},

  abstract  = {The need for fast and accurate performance testing of solar collectors is increasing. This paper describes a new technique for performance testing which is based on non-linear continuous time models of the heat dynamics of the collector. It is shown that all important performance parameters can be accurately estimated with measurements from a single day. The estimated parameters are compared with results from standardized test methods (Fischer et al., 2004). Modelling the dynamics of the collector is carried out using stochastic differential equations, which is a well proven ef?cient method to obtain accurate estimates of parameters in physical models. The applied method is described by Kristensen et al. (2004) and implemented in the software CTSM1 . Examples of successful applications of the method includes modelling the of the heat dynamics of integrated photo-voltaic modules (Friling et al., 2009) and modelling of the heat dynamics of buildings (Madsen and Holst, 1995). Measurements obtained at a test site in Denmark during the spring 2010 are used for the modelling. The tested collector is a single glazed large area ?at plate collector with selective absorber and Te?on anti convection layer. The test rig is described in Fan et al. (2009). The modelling technique provides uncertainty estimates such as con?dence intervals for the parameters, and furthermore enables statistical validation of the results. Such tests can also facilitate procedures for selecting the best model to use, which is a very non-trivial task.},

  Abstract                 = {A first research version is now in operation of a software package for multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling and analysis of solar collectors according to ideas originating all the way from Walletun et. al. (1986), Perers, (1987 and 1993). The tool has been implemented in the free and open source program R http://www.r-project.org/. Applications of the software package includes: visual validation, resampling and conversion of data, collector performance testing analysis according to the European Standard EN 12975 (Fischer et al., 2004), statistical validation of results, and the determination of collector incidence angle modifiers without the need of a mathematical function (Perers, 1997). The paper gives a demonstration with examples of the applications, based on measurements obtained at a test site at DTU in Denmark (Fan et al., 2009). The tested collector is a single glazed large area flat plate collector with selective absorber and teflon anti convection layer. The package is intended to enable fast and reliable validation of data, and provide a united implementation for MLR testing of solar collectors. This will furthermore make it simple to replicate the calculations by a third party in order to validate the results. Finally more advanced methods can be implemented and easily shared as extensions to the package, for example methods for statistical estimation of the incidence angle modifier with non-linear functions for collectors with more complicated optics. The overall advantage of this kind of tool and analysis is that it is almost the inverse of simulation. Therefore the model and parameters will be very well validated for application in later use for system simulation, even if the test is no real system test. Also for annual collector performance calculations with a new Excel tool connected to EN 12975 (Kovacs, 2011) this built in validation gives an extra quality assurance.},

The primary significance of this model is its simplicity, which allows it to be used on small desk-top computers. The spectrum produced by this model is limited to 0.3–4.0 μm wavelength with an approximate resolution of 10 nm.},

  abstract  = {Increasing penetration levels of wind and solar power in the energy system call for the development of Smart Grid enabling technologies. As an alternative to expensive electro-chemical and mechanical storage options, the thermal energy demand in buildings offers a cost-effective option for intermittency-friendly electricity consumption patterns. Combining hot and cold thermal storages with new high-pressure compressor technology that allows for flexible and simultaneous production of useful heat and cooling, the paper introduces and investigates the high-efficiency Thermal Battery (TB) concept. In a proof-of-concept case study, the TB replaces an existing electric resistance heater used for hot water production and an electric compressor used for air refrigeration in a central air conditioning system. A mathematical model for least-cost unit dispatch is developed. Heat pump cycle components and thermal storages are designed and optimized. A general methodology is applied that allows for comparing the obtained results with other Smart Grid enabling options. It is found that the TB concept leads to improvements in the intermittency-friendliness of operation Rc (improves from -0.11 to 0.46), lower CO2 emissions (reduced to zero), and lower operational costs (reduced by 72%). The results indicate that TB may be the most cost-effective Smart Grid enabling option for supporting higher penetration levels of intermittent renewables in the energy system.},

This research has shown that numerous sources of error have existed in previous studies leading to uncertainty in model predictions. The effects of these errors has meant that none of the previous empirical validation studies would have produced conclusive evidence of internal errors in the models themselves.

  abstract  = { Lower costs and improved performance of sensors, controllers, and networking is leading to the development of smart building features, such as continuous performance monitoring, automated diagnostics, and optimal supervisory control. For some of these applications, it is important to be able to predict transient cooling and heating requirements for the building using inverse models that are trained using on-site data. Existing inverse models for transient building loads range from purely empirical or “black-box” models to purely physical or “white-box” models. Generally, black-box (e.g., neural network) models require a significant amount of training data and may not always reflect the actual physical behavior, whereas white-box (e.g., finite difference) models require specification of many physical parameters. This paper presents a hybrid or “gray-box” modeling approach that uses a transfer function with parameters that are constrained to satisfy a simple physical representation for energy flows in the building structure. A robust method is also presented for training parameters of the constrained model, wherein initial values of and bounds on physical parameters are estimated from a rough building description, better estimates are obtained using a global direct search algorithm, and optimal parameters are identified using a nonlinear regression algorithm. The model and training method were extensively tested for different buildings and locations using data generated from a detailed simulation program. The approach was also tested using data from a field site located near Chicago, Illinois. It was found that one to two weeks of data are sufficient to train a model so that it can accurately predict transient cooling or heating requirements. },

Most of the work in the literature relates to offices and homes. However, this paper investigates a supermarket in northern England by means of a multiple regression analysis based on gas and electricity data for 2012. The equations obtained in this analysis use the humidity ratio derived from the dry-bulb temperature and the relative humidity in conjunction with the actual dry-bulb temperature. These equations are used to estimate the consumption for the base year period (1961–1990) and for the predicted climate period 2030–2059. The findings indicate that electricity use will increase by 2.1% whereas gas consumption will drop by about 13% for the central future estimate. The research further suggests that the year 2012 is comparable in temperature to the future climate, but the relative humidity is lower. Further research should include adaptation/mitigation measures and an evaluation of their usefulness. },

The approach has several advantages, such as no distributional assumptions and flexible inclusion of predictive information. In addition, it can be shown that, for some purposes, forecasts in terms of quantiles provide the type of information required to make optimal economic decisions.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel approach to short-time load forecasting by the application of nonparametric regression. The method is derived from a load model in the form of a probability density function of load and load affecting factors. A load forecast is a conditional expectation of load given the time, weather conditions and other explanatory variables. This forecast can be calculated directly from historical data as a local average of observed past loads with the size of the local neighborhood and the specific weights on the loads defined by a multivariate product kernel. The method accuracy relies on the adequate representation of possible future conditions by historical data, but a measure to detect any unreliable forecast can be easily constructed. The proposed procedure requires few parameters that can be easily calculated from historical data by applying the cross-validation technique},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, an adaptive ARMA (autoregressive moving-average) model is developed for short-term load forecasting of a power system. For short-term load forecasting, the Box-Jenkins transfer function approach has been regarded as one of the most accurate methods. However, the Box-Jenkins approach without adapting the forecasting errors available to update the forecast has limited accuracy. The adaptive approach first derives the error learning coefficients by virtue of minimum mean square error (MMSE) theory and then updates the forecasts based on the one-step-ahead forecast errors and the coefficients. Due to its adaptive capability, the algorithm can deal with any unusual system condition. The employed algorithm has been tested and compared with the Box-Jenkins approach. The results of 24-hours- and one-week-ahead forecasts show that the adaptive algorithm is more accurate than the conventional Box-Jenkins approach, especially for the 24-hour case. © 1995.},

A systematic methodology is described for predictive supervisory operation. The focus of this study is on the development of an operation supervisor that can determine optimal operation strategies for building thermal processes, and its application to a floor heating system in a passive solar room with thermal mass. An optimal model associated with a number of practical operation constraints is formulated, and an approach that combines dynamic programming and on-line simulation is developed, to efficiently solve the problem in real-time. Simulations for the minimisation of energy consumption and operating cost, with different operation schedules under various weather conditions. are performed. Results show that the techniques are computationally efficient and that the predictive supervisory operation of floor heating systems may lead to significant savings in energy consumption and operating cost.

Theoretical calculation methods to determine the z-transfer function coefficients, which characterize the dynamic thermal performance of building components, do exist, but these depend on a number of assumptions and one must supplement them with experimental techniques. This paper discusses a neural-network-based system identification technique to determine the z-transfer function of a building envelope from experimental data. A multi-layer neural network is trained by the samples constructed from the dynamically measured data of heat conduction process through a wall. The Markov parameters, which are produced from the weighting matrices of the network, are utilized to realize the minimal state space model of the wall by eigensystem realization algorithm. The z-transfer function coefficients are obtained by the algorithm transforming the state space model into z-transfer function. The results show that this technique has some advantages in programming and computational simplicity, very good properties of noise rejection and improved accuracy of the results. The training time of the network is greatly reduced by adopting the adaptive learning algorithm. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The performance of models to estimate solar irradiance and its components is assessed using data for six Canadian stations for nine years (1968–1976). Greatest emphasis is placed on a model, the MAC model, which uses cloud information from different layers. Here, effects on model estimates of using observed cloud layer opacities instead of amounts is examined because after 1976 the latter quantity is no longer recorded. Effects of aerosol are also examined. Two other models are considered here; a version of the MAC model which uses total cloud information rather than layer information, and Rietveld's[1] sunshine-based model. In general, the layer model yielded the best results. This is in agreement with a previous Canadian study[2]. RMSE values are between 11 and 15 percent for global irradiance on a daily basis and decrease below 10 percent for averaging periods greater than 2–4 days. Daily RMSE values for the direct beam and diffuse components are 25 per cent. These decrease below 10 per cent for averaging periods larger than 10–15 days. Errors increase when layer opacities are used but results are still acceptable. Aerosol effects can be neglected for much of the country except in Montreal and Toronto. Rietveld's model gives results of lower accuracy than the MAC model but may be useful for quick, easy estimates. The MAC model using total cloud amount performed poorly.},

  abstract  = {If values of ambient temperature and room temperature are known at hourly intervals, the heat flow to or from the room at some specified time can be computed in terms of the values of recent temperatures and heat flows, weighted by values of a series of N wall transfer coefficients, bk, or ck, and dk, (k = 0 to N). These coefficients have hitherto been found by frequency domain methods. It is shown here that they can be evaluated using elementary time domain solutions for wall heat flow. A multi-layer wall with surface films representing radiant and convective exchange is discussed. Using suitable transmission matrices, solutions for the steady-progressive and transient temperature profiles through the wall are derived. The value of N and the wall dk values follow immediately from the wall decay times of the transient solution, together with the choice of 1 hour as time interval. Using a development of Fourier analysis, the steady-progressive and transient solutions are combined so as to provide the time-domain solution for the response to an imposed ramp in ambient or room temperature. Combination of three such ramps forms a triangular temperature pulse of excitation and the infinite series of wall response factors -hourly values of heat flow at and after the temperature peak- serve to describe the response of the wall when excited by such a pulse. The values of bk and ck follow from the response factors. The procedure is illustrated numerically.},

The transmission matrices of the real wall and a chain of simple T sections (1, 2, 3 or 4 units) are evaluated and the T section elements are systematically varied so as to minimise the sums of squares of the differences between the corresponding pairs of the 4 vector elements in the 2 matrices. For a thin wall this procedure is demonstrated analytically for up to 3 sections. The sum of squares is proportional to the fourth power of the slab thickness. Tables are provided of the optimum values for the elements of a homogeneous slab when represented by 1-4 T sections. The investigation is extended to a homogeneous slab flanked by equal and unequal surface films, and the possibility of a degenerate solution for a thin slab is demonstrated. Finally, the case of an entire wall construction is discussed; of a group of 29 walls and roofs, most can be satisfactorily modelled by a 3 T section network consisting of 6 lumped elements. Exact modelling may be possible.},

It rests on both residuals analysis techniques and comparisons between model outputs uncertainty bands and measurements uncertainty intervals. Second step intends to explain the differences observed between model simulations and measurements. A new approach for models diagnosis has been proposed. It rests on the analysis of the model parameters space. The main objective is to identify the changes in parameters values that are required for a significant model behaviour improvement. Diagnosis is then provided by comparison of such results with the knowledge we have about both the actual system and the model itself. Main mathematical tools for diagnosis are sensitivity analysis and optimisation techniques. The methodology and the underlying methods we are proposing are presented in the first part of the paper. In the second part, they are applied for testing modelling hypothesis in the framework of the thermal analysis of an actual building. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

When the real-time price differs for generators that are short and long, the optimal forward strategy must be based on the opportunity costs of charges and payments in real-time rather than a central estimate of wind output. We present analytical results for wind's optimal forward strategy. In the risk-neutral case, the optimal strategy is determined by the distribution of real-time available wind capacity, and the expected real-time prices conditioned on the forward price and wind out-turn; our approach is simpler and more computationally efficient than formulations requiring specification of full joint distributions or a large set of scenarios. Informative closed-form examples are derived for particular specifications of the wind-price dependence structure. In the usual case of uncertain forward prices, the optimal bidding strategy generally consists of a bid curve for wind power, rather than a fixed quantity bid. A discussion of the risk-averse problem is also provided. An analytical result is available for aversion to production volume risk; however, we doubt whether wind owners should be risk-averse with respect to the income from a single settlement period, given the large number of such periods in a year.},

Foremost of these is the quantification and provision of system reserve. In this paper a new methodology is presented which quantifies the reserve needed on a system taking into account the uncertain nature of the wind power. Generator outage rates and load and wind power forecasts are taken into consideration when quantifying the amount of reserve needed. The reliability of the system is used as an objective measure to determine the effect of increasing wind power penetration. The methodology is applied to a model of the all Ireland electricity system, and results show that as wind power capacity increases, the system must increase the amount of reserve carried or face a measurable decrease in reliability.},

The outdoor temperature, together with the social behaviour of the consumers, have the greatest influence on the demand. This is also the core of the load prediction model developed in this paper. Several methodologies have been proposed for heat-load forecasting, but due to lack in measured data and due to the uncertainties that are present in the weather forecasts, many of them will fail in practice. In such situations, a more simple model may give as good predictions as an advanced one. This is also the experience from the applications analyzed in this paper.},

Many operating decisions are based on load forecasts, such as dispatch scheduling of generating capacity, reliability analysis, and maintenance planning for the generators. Overestimation of electricity demand will cause a conservative operation, which leads to the start-up of too many units or excessive energy purchase, thereby supplying an unnecessary level of reserve. On the other hand, underestimation may result in a risky operation, with insufficient preparation of spinning reserve, causing the system to operate in a vulnerable region to the disturbance. In this paper, semi-parametric additive models are proposed to estimate the relationships between demand and the driver variables. Specifically, the inputs for these models are calendar variables, lagged actual demand observations, and historical and forecast temperature traces for one or more sites in the target power system. In addition to point forecasts, prediction intervals are also estimated using a modified bootstrap method suitable for the complex seasonality seen in electricity demand data. The proposed methodology has been used to forecast the half-hourly electricity demand for up to seven days ahead for power systems in the Australian National Electricity Market. The performance of the methodology is validated via out-of-sample experiments with real data from the power system, as well as through on-site implementation by the system operator.},

  Abstract                 = {In the new competitive electricity markets, the necessity of appropriate load forecasting tools for accurate scheduling is completely evident. The model which is utilised for the forecasting purposes determines how much the forecasted results would be dependable. In this regard, this paper proposes a new hybrid forecasting method based on the wavelet transform, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural network (ANN) for short-term load forecasting. In the proposed model, the autocorrelation function and the partial autocorrelation function are utilised to see the stationary or non-stationary behaviour of the load time series. Then, by the use of Akaike information criterion, the appropriate order of the ARIMA model is found. Now, the ARIMA model would capture the linear component of the load time series and the residuals would contain only the nonlinear components. The nonlinear part would be decomposed by the discrete wavelet transform into its sub-frequencies. Several ANNs are applied to the details and approximation components of the residuals signal to predict the future load sample. Finally, the outputs of the ARIMA and ANNs are summed. The empirical results show that the proposed hybrid method can improve the load forecasting accuracy suitably.},

The results prove that the whole-house electricity consumption can be disaggregated into its major end-uses, using a pattern recognition approach and only one sensor installed on the main electric entrance of the house. It also required a one-time submetering of the target appliances during the training period, of about a week, to find the electric characteristics of appliances. The results are provided in terms of daily load profiles, energy consumption and energy contribution of selected appliances. The proposed method was tested with monitored data from 3 weeks: (i) the training period of 1 week in October, (ii) the near-to-date testing period of 1 week in November and (iii) the far-to-date testing period of 1 week in January. For instance, the difference between monitored and estimated contribution is, for the month of October 1996, as follows: (i) 13 kW h or $0.85 for the \{DHW\} heater and (ii) 6 kW h or $0.36 for the refrigerator. The overall difference for both appliances does not exceed $1.25 for the month of October, for a total electricity bill of 912 kW h and $60.60, which appears to be acceptable for every homeowner. The errors in evaluating the daily energy consumption is between −10.5% and 15.9% for both the \{DWH\} heater and the refrigerator. },

With the publication of this European standard all national standards, related to the same topic, have to be withdrawn by the nations of the European Community. Now only one standard for testing solar collectors is valid throughout Europe. This European Standard specifies test methods for validating the durability, reliability and safety requirements for liquid heating collectors. The standard also includes two alternative test methods for the thermal performance characterization for liquid heating collectors. Apart from the well-known test method under steady-state conditions according to ISO 9806-1, ISO 9806-3 and ASHRAE 93-77 the EN 12975 permits a quasi-dynamic test method for the thermal performance characterization of solar thermal collectors. This paper presents the improved approach to outdoor performance testing of solar thermal collectors under quasi-dynamic test conditions. The test requirements and collector theory are closely connected to those long agreed on for steady-state testing, as described in the ISO and ASHRAE standards mentioned above. The most important effects for the all day performance of the collector are taken into account. The test method covers most collector designs on the market today (except ICS type). Only some correction terms are added to the basic collector models of the present steady-state test methods. Still this limited change will allow test data to be collected and used from whole days. An important fact is that the collector model used for the parameter identification is written so that the error in collector output power is minimized. Therefore an accurate long-term prediction of the collector performance can be an integral part of the test method, where the same collector model and parameters are used for both testing and prediction.},

Consequently, the prediction system ought to be probabilistic in nature, with the predictions taking the form of probability distributions. This paper concerns probabilistic prediction systems where the data are assumed to follow either a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution or a generalized Pareto distribution. In this setting, the properties of proper scoring rules that facilitate the assessment of the prediction uncertainty are investigated, and closed form expressions for the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) are provided. In an application to peak wind prediction, the predictive performance of a GEV model under maximum likelihood estimation, optimum score estimation with the CRPS, and a Bayesian framework are compared. The Bayesian inference yields the highest overall prediction skill and is shown to be a valuable tool for covariate selection, while the predictions obtained under optimum CRPS estimation are the sharpest and give the best performance for high thresholds and quantiles.

  abstract  = {So far, solar energy has been viewed as only a minor contributor in the energy mixture of the US due to cost and intermittency constraints. However, recent drastic cost reductions in the production of photovoltaics (PV) pave the way for enabling this technology to become cost competitive with fossil fuel energy generation. We show that with the right incentives, cost competitiveness with grid prices in the US (e.g., 6–10&#xa0;US¢/kWh) can be attained by 2020. The intermittency problem is solved by integrating PV with compressed air energy storage (CAES) and by extending the thermal storage capability in concentrated solar power (CSP). We used hourly load data for the entire US and 45-year solar irradiation data from the southwest region of the US, to simulate the CAES storage requirements, under worst weather conditions. Based on expected improvements of established, commercially available PV, CSP, and CAES technologies, we show that solar energy has the technical, geographical, and economic potential to supply 69% of the total electricity needs and 35% of the total (electricity and fuel) energy needs of the US by 2050. When we extend our scenario to 2100, solar energy supplies over 90%, and together with other renewables, 100% of the total US energy demand with a corresponding 92% reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions compared to the 2005 levels.},

  Abstract                 = {The project “Solar/electric heating systems in the future energy system” was carried out in the period 2008‐2013. The project partners were DTU Byg, DTU Informatics (now DTU Compute), DMI, ENFOR A/S and COWI A/S. The companies Ajva ApS, Ohmatex ApS and Innogie ApS worked together with the project partners in two connected projects in order to develop solar/electric heating systems for laboratory tests. The project was financed by the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation under the Danish Council for Strategic Research in the program Sustainable Energy and Environment. The DSF number of the project is 2104‐07‐0021/09‐063201/DSF. This report is the final report of the project. The aim of the project is to elucidate how individual heating units for single family houses are best designed in order to fit into the future energy system. The units are based on solar energy, electrical heating elements/heat pump, advanced heat storage tanks and advanced control systems. Heat is produced by solar collectors in sunny periods and by electrical heating elements/heat pump. The electrical heating elements/heat pump will be in operation in periods where the heat demand cannot be covered by solar energy. The aim is to use the auxiliary heating units when the electricity price is low, e.g. due to large electricity production by wind turbines. The unit is equipped with an advanced control system where the control of the auxiliary heating is based on forecasts of the electricity price, the heat demand and the solar energy production. Consequently, the control is based on weather forecasts. Three differently designed heating units are tested in a laboratory test facility. The systems are compared on the basis of: - energy consumption for the auxiliary heating - energy cost for the auxiliary heating - net utilized solar energy},

Since this problem of quality control is of concern to many researchers and engineers and since it is often a lengthy and tedious task, we decided to make this screening procedure available to everyone as a web service. This service is the purpose of this paper. The objective is not to perform a precise and fine control, an objective out of reach without details on the site and instruments, but to perform a likelihood control of the data and to check their plausibility. This is achieved by comparing observations with some expectations based upon the extraterrestrial irradiation and a simulation of the irradiation for clear skies. This service is available to everyone on the Web site www.helioclim.net. It offers a very convenient means to check time-series of irradiation: data are input in a HTML page by a copy and paste procedure and the return is also a HTML page that can be analyzed in detail for the data flagged as suspicious.},

The solution proposed in this paper is to use the range between the 1st and the 3rd quartile of the quantileâquantile (qâq) plot to check if the heating losses and the outdoor temperature have the same distribution and, if yes, to perform the regression in this range of the qâq plot. The result is a model that conserves its prediction performance for data sets of the outdoor temperature different of those used for parameter identification. The robust model gives the overall heat transfer coefficient and the base temperature, and it may be used to estimate the energy consumption for data sets of the outdoor temperature coming from different timeâspace locations. },

  abstract  = {Loss functions play a central role in the theory and practice of forecasting. If the loss function is quadratic, the mean of the predictive distribution is the unique optimal point predictor. If the loss is symmetric piecewise linear, any median is an optimal point forecast. Quantiles arise as optimal point forecasts under a general class of economically relevant loss functions, which nests the asymmetric piecewise linear loss, and which we refer to as generalized piecewise linear (GPL). The level of the quantile depends on a generic asymmetry parameter which reflects the possibly distinct costs of underprediction and overprediction. Conversely, a loss function for which quantiles are optimal point forecasts is necessarily GPL. We review characterizations of this type in the work of Thomson, Saerens and Komunjer, and relate to proper scoring rules, incentive-compatible compensation schemes and quantile regression. In the empirical part of the paper, the relevance of decision theoretic guidance in the transition from a predictive distribution to a point forecast is illustrated using the Bank of England’s density forecasts of United Kingdom inflation rates, and probabilistic predictions of wind energy resources in the Pacific Northwest. },

The results are stated formally by defining the notion of "output distinguishability." Parameter identifiability is then defined precisely in terms of output distinguishability. Relationships have been developed with the other definitions such as least square identifiability and identifiability from the transfer function. Several results for linear and nonlinear systems are presented with examples.},

The resulting grey-box model was used for Economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) of the energy in the tank. The control objective was to balance the energy from a solar collector and the heat consumption in a residential house. The storage tank provides heat in periods where there is low solar radiation and stores heat when there is surplus solar heat. The forecasts of consumption patterns were based on data obtained from meters in a group of single-family houses in Denmark. The tank can also be heated by electric heating elements if necessary, but the electricity costs of operating these heating elements should be minimized. Consequently, the heating elements should be used in periods with cheap electricity. It is proposed to integrate a price-sensitive control to enable the storage tank to serve a smart energy system in which flexible consumers are expected to help balance fluctuating renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Through simulations, the impact of applying Economic MPC shows annual electricity cost savings up to 25-30\%.},

  abstract  = {Summary.  Multivariate extreme value theory and methods concern the characterization, estimation and extrapolation of the joint tail of the distribution of a d-dimensional random variable. Existing approaches are based on limiting arguments in which all components of the variable become large at the same rate. This limit approach is inappropriate when the extreme values of all the variables are unlikely to occur together or when interest is in regions of the support of the joint distribution where only a subset of components is extreme. In practice this restricts existing methods to applications where d is typically 2 or 3. Under an assumption about the asymptotic form of the joint distribution of a d-dimensional random variable conditional on its having an extreme component, we develop an entirely new semiparametric approach which overcomes these existing restrictions and can be applied to problems of any dimension. We demonstrate the performance of our approach and its advantages over existing methods by using theoretical examples and simulation studies. The approach is used to analyse air pollution data and reveals complex extremal dependence behaviour that is consistent with scientific understanding of the process. We find that the dependence structure exhibits marked seasonality, with ex- tremal dependence between some pollutants being significantly greater than the dependence at non-extreme levels.},

The opposite is true for solar power generation. In a future Europe with a very high share of renewable power generation those two opposite behaviors are able to counterbalance each other to a certain extent to follow the seasonal load curve. The best point of counterbalancing represents the seasonal optimal mix between wind and solar power generation. It leads to a pronounced minimum in required stored energy. For a 100% renewable Europe the seasonal optimal mix becomes 55% wind and 45% solar power generation. For less than 100% renewable scenarios the fraction of wind power generation increases and that of solar power generation decreases.},

They decrease strongly with the overall excess generation. At 50% excess generation the required long-term storage energy capacity and annual balancing energy amount to 1% of the annual consumption.

  abstract  = {Cooling of commercial buildings contributes significantly to the peak demand placed on an electrical utility grid. Time-of-use electricity rates encourage shifting of electrical loads to off-peak periods at night and weekends. Buildings can respond to these pricing signals by shifting cooling-related thermal loads either by precooling the building's massive structure or by using active thermal energy storage systems such as ice storage. While these two thermal batteries have been engaged separately in the past, this paper investigates the merits of harnessing both storage media concurrently in the context of optimal control. The objective function is the total utility bill including the cost of heating and a time-of-use electricity rate without demand charges. The evaluation of the combined optimal control assumes perfect weather prediction and plant modeling, which justifies the application of a consecutive time block optimization that optimizes 24 hour horizons sequentially. The analysis shows that the combined utilization leads to cost savings that is significantly greater than either storage but less than the sum of the individual savings. The findings reveal that the cooling-related on-peak electrical demand of commercial buildings can be drastically reduced and justify the development of a predictive optimal controller that accounts for uncertainty in predicted variables and modeling mismatch in real time.},

The conclusions are that the accuracy of the input parameters such as the turbidity is crucial in the validity of the obtained radiation components, and that the choice of a specific model is secondary.

Here, we analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for all purposes (electric power, transportation, heating/cooling, etc.) from wind, water, and sunlight (WWS). In Part I, we discuss WWS energy system characteristics, current and future energy demand, availability of WWS resources, numbers of WWS devices, and area and material requirements. In Part II, we address variability, economics, and policy of WWS energy. We estimate that ∼3,800,000 5&#xa0;MW wind turbines, ∼49,000 300&#xa0;MW concentrated solar plants, ∼40,000 300&#xa0;MW solar PV power plants, ∼1.7 billion 3&#xa0;kW rooftop PV systems, ∼5350 100&#xa0;MW geothermal power plants, ∼270 new 1300&#xa0;MW hydroelectric power plants, ∼720,000 0.75&#xa0;MW wave devices, and ∼490,000 1&#xa0;MW tidal turbines can power a 2030 WWS world that uses electricity and electrolytic hydrogen for all purposes. Such a WWS infrastructure reduces world power demand by 30% and requires only ∼0.41% and ∼0.59% more of the world's land for footprint and spacing, respectively. We suggest producing all new energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing the pre-existing energy by 2050. Barriers to the plan are primarily social and political, not technological or economic. The energy cost in a WWS world should be similar to that today.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Buildings are the dominant source of energy consumption and environmental emissions in urban areas. Therefore, the ability to forecast and characterize building energy consumption is vital to implementing urban energy management and efficiency initiatives required to curb emissions. Advances in smart metering technology have enabled researchers to develop “sensor based” approaches to forecast building energy consumption that necessitate less input data than traditional methods. Sensor-based forecasting utilizes machine learning techniques to infer the complex relationships between consumption and influencing variables (e.g., weather, time of day, previous consumption). While sensor-based forecasting has been studied extensively for commercial buildings, there is a paucity of research applying this data-driven approach to the multi-family residential sector. In this paper, we build a sensor-based forecasting model using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a commonly used machine learning technique, and apply it to an empirical data-set from a multi-family residential building in New York City. We expand our study to examine the impact of temporal (i.e., daily, hourly, 10&#xa0;min intervals) and spatial (i.e., whole building, by floor, by unit) granularity have on the predictive power of our single-step model. Results indicate that sensor based forecasting models can be extended to multi-family residential buildings and that the optimal monitoring granularity occurs at the by floor level in hourly intervals. In addition to implications for the development of residential energy forecasting models, our results have practical significance for the deployment and installation of advanced smart metering devices. Ultimately, accurate and cost effective wide-scale energy prediction is a vital step towards next-generation energy efficiency initiatives, which will require not only consideration of the methods, but the scales for which data can be distilled into meaningful information. },

In the detrending phase, several models are applied to remove the non-stationary trend lying in the solar radiation series. To judge the goodness of different detrending models, the Augmented Dickey?Fuller method is applied to test the stationarity of the residual. The optimal model is used to detrend the solar radiation series. In the prediction phase, the Autoregressive and Moving Average (ARMA) model is used to predict the stationary residual series. Furthermore, the controversial Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is applied to do the prediction. Because ARMA and TDNN have their own strength respectively, a novel hybrid model that combines both the ARMA and TDNN, is applied to produce better prediction. The simulation result shows that this hybrid model can take the advantages of both ARMA and TDNN and give excellent result.},

  abstract  = {Outdoor testing of buildings and building components under real weather conditions provides useful information about their dynamic performance. Such knowledge is needed to properly characterize the heat transfer dynamics and provides useful information for implementing energy saving strategies, for example. For the analysis of these tests, dynamic analysis models and methods are required. However, a wide variety of models and methods exists, and the problem of choosing the most appropriate approach for each particular case is a non-trivial and interdisciplinary task. Knowledge of a large family of these approaches may therefore be very useful for selecting a suitable approach for each particular case. This paper presents an overview of models that can be applied for modelling the thermal characteristics of buildings and building components using data from outdoor testing. The choice of approach depends on the purpose of the modelling, existence of prior physical knowledge, the data and the available statistical tools. In this paper, a variety of models are outlined and compared, and a strong relationship among a large number of widely used linear and stationary stochastic models is mathematically demonstrated. The characteristics of each type of model are highlighted. Some available software tools for each of the methods described will be mentioned. A case study also demonstrating the difference between linear and nonlinear models is considered. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To overcome such a situation, a major effort has been undertaken at the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMIB) to develop procedures and software for performing post-measurement quality control of solar data from the radiometric stations of our in situ solar monitoring network. Moreover, because solar energy applications usually need continuous time series of solar radiation data, additional procedures have also been established to fill missing values (data initially lacking or removed via quality checks).},

Out of the 28 000 electricity customers on Bornholm, 2000 residential consumers will participate with flexible demand. A major part of the participants will be equipped with residential demand response devices with intelligent controllers, enabling customers to respond to real-time prices and allow users to pre-program their automatic demand-response preferences. This paper presents the concept of a real-time market and information architecture, which gives numerous small end-users and local producers of distributed energy new options for offering TSO additional balancing and ancillary services.},

The storage device is used to balance the power fluctuations of the non-dispatchable generator in order to feed power into the network according to an hourly pre-determined constant profile. The negative effects of inaccurate forecasts are thus reduced by turning the stochastic generation into a deterministic network infeed. Important parameters for achieving this goal are the energy capacity of the energy storage and the error magnitude of the forecast used to define the infeed profile. A general method for simulations based on a measurement series is presented, together with a method for the simulation of forecasts with different forecast errors. The methodology is then applied in a case study to investigate the feasibility of using an storage device for hourly balancing. The emphasis is on the relation between infeed accuracy, forecast error and energy capacity of the storage},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive improvement of the mathematical model for the so called transfer function method is presented in this study. This improved transfer function method can estimate the traditional solar collector parameters such as zero loss coefficient and heat loss coefficient. Two new collector parameters t and mfCf are obtained. t is a time scale parameter which can indicate the heat transfer ability of the solar collector. mfCf can be used to calculate the fluid volume content in the solar collector or to validate the regression process by comparing it to the physical fluid volume content if known. Experiments were carried out under dynamic test conditions and then test data were processed using multi-linear regression method to get collector parameters with statistic analysis. A comparison of the collector parameters obtained from the improved transfer function (ITF) method and the quasi-dynamic test (QDT) method is carried out. The results show that the improved transfer function method can accurately obtain reasonable collector parameters. The influence of different averaging time intervals is investigated. Based on the investigation it is recommended to use on line calculation if applicable for the second-order differential term with 6–9min as the best averaging time interval. The measured and predicted collector power output of the solar collector are compared during a test of 13days continuously both for the ITF method and the QDT method. The maximum and averaging error is 53.87W/m2 and 5.22W/m2 respectively of the ITF method while 64.13W/m2 and 6.22W/m2 of the QDT method. Scatter and relative error distribution of the measured power output versus the predicted power output is also plotted for the two methods. No matter in either error analysis or scatter distribution, the ITF method is more accurate than the QDT method in predicting the power output of a solar collector.In conclusion, all the results show that the improved transfer function method can accurately and robustly estimate solar collector parameters and predict solar collector thermal performance under dynamic test conditions.},

The method of coupling three-dimensional heat transfer modeling and dynamic hot-box tests for complex wall systems with the whole building thermal simulations is presented in this paper. This procedure can increase the accuracy of the whole building thermal modeling. Current thermal modeling and calculation procedures tend to overestimate the actual field thermal performance of today's popular building envelope designs, which utilize modem building technologies (sometimes highly conductive structural materials) and feature large fenestration areas and floor plans with many exterior wall corners. Some widely used computer codes were calibrated using field data obtained from light weight wood frame buildings. The same codes are used now for thermal modeling of high mass buildings with significant heat accumulation effects. Also. the effects of extensive thermal shorts on the whole building thermal performance is not accurately reflected by the commonly used one-dimensional energy simulations that are the current bases for building envelopes and systems designing.

  abstract  = {Global energy consumption is projected to increase, even in the face of substantial declines in energy intensity, at least 2-fold by midcentury relative to the present because of population and economic growth. This demand could be met, in principle, from fossil energy resources, particularly coal. However, the cumulative nature of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere demands that holding atmospheric CO2 levels to even twice their preanthropogenic values by midcentury will require invention, development, and deployment of schemes for carbon-neutral energy production on a scale commensurate with, or larger than, the entire present-day energy supply from all sources combined. Among renewable energy resources, solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource, providing more energy in 1 hour to the earth than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. In view of the intermittency of insolation, if solar energy is to be a major primary energy source, it must be stored and dispatched on demand to the end user. An especially attractive approach is to store solar-converted energy in the form of chemical bonds, i.e., in a photosynthetic process at a year-round average efficiency significantly higher than current plants or algae, to reduce land-area requirements. Scientific challenges involved with this process include schemes to capture and convert solar energy and then store the energy in the form of chemical bonds, producing oxygen from water and a reduced fuel such as hydrogen, methane, methanol, or other hydrocarbon species.},

  Abstract                 = {Even for similar residential buildings, a huge variability in the energy consumption can be observed. This variability is mainly due to the different behaviours of the occupants and this impacts the thermal (temperature setting, window opening, etc.) as well as the electrical (appliances, TV, computer, etc.) consumption.It is very seldom to find direct observations of occupant presence and behaviour in residential buildings. However, given the increasing use of smart metering, the opportunity and potential for indirect observation and classification of occupants’ behaviour is possible. This paper focuses on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to create methods for indirect observations and characterisation of occupant behaviour.By applying homogeneous HMMs on the electricity consumption of fourteen apartments, three states describing the data were found suitable. The most likely sequence of states was determined (global decoding). From reconstruction of the states, dependencies like ambient air temperature were investigated. Combined with an occupant survey, this was used to classify/interpret the states as (1) absent or asleep, (2) home, medium consumption and (3) home, high consumption. From the global decoding, the average probability profiles with respect to time of day were investigated, and four distinct patterns of occupant behaviour were observed. Based on the initial results of the homogeneous HMMs and with the observed dependencies, time dependent HMMs (inhomogeneous HMMs) were developed, which improved forecasting. For both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous HMMs, indications of common parameters were observed, which suggests further development of the HMMs as population models.},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with grey-box modelling of the energy transfer of a double skin Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) system. Grey-box models are based on a combination of prior physical knowledge and statistics, which enable identification of the unknown parameters in the system and accurate prediction of the most influential variables. The experimental data originates from tests carried out with an air-based BIPV system installed in a Test Reference Environment. BIPV systems represent an interesting application for achieving the requirements of the EU EPBD Directive. Indeed, these systems could reduce the ventilation thermal losses of the building by pre-heating the fresh air. Furthermore, by decreasing PV module temperature, the ventilation air heat extraction can simultaneously increase electrical and thermal energy production of the building. A correct prediction of the PV module temperature and heat transfer coefficients is fundamental in order to improve the thermo-electrical production.The considered grey-box models are composed of a set of continuous time stochastic differential equations, holding the physical description of the system, combined with a set of discrete time measurement equations, which represent the data driven part.In the present work, both one-state and two-state non-linear grey-box models are considered. In order to validate the results, the residuals are analysed for white-noise properties.},

  abstract                   = {The largest-ever exercise to validate dynamic thermal simulation programs (DSPs) of buildings has recently been completed, It involved 25 program/user combinations from Europe, the USA and Australia, and included both commercial and public domain programs, Predictions were produced for three single zone test rooms in the UK. These had either a single-glazed or double-glazed south-facing window, or no window at all. In one 10-day period the rooms were intermittently heated and in another 10-day period they were unheated. The predictions of heating energy demands and air temperatures were compared. The observed interprogram variability was highly likely to be due to inherent differences between the DSPs, rather than the way they were used. Predictions of the difference in performance of two rooms were no more consistent than predictions of the absolute performance of a single room, By comparing the predictions with the measurements and taking due account of experimental uncertainty, the DSPs that are likely to contain significant internal errors are distinguished from those which, in these tests, performed much better. The likely sources of internal error are discussed. It is recommended that empirical validation exercises should consist of an initial blind phase in which program users are unaware of the actual measured performance of the building, and then an open phase in which the measurements are made available. The work has produced five empirical validation benchmarks, which have significant practical benefits for program users, vendors and potential purchasers. There is considerable scope for improving the predictive ability of DSPs and so suggestions for further work are made. (C) 1997 Building Research Establishment. Published by Elsevier Science S.A.},

  abstract  = {The contribution of power production from PV systems to the electricity supply is constantly increasing. An efficient use of the fluctuating solar power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the expected power production, as a basis for management of the electricity grids and trading on the energy market. We present and evaluate the regional PV power prediction system of University of Oldenburg and Meteocontrol GmbH providing forecasts of up to 2 days ahead with hourly resolution. The proposed approach is based on forecasts of the global model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF). It includes a post-processing procedure to derive optimised, site-specific irradiance forecasts and explicit physical modelling steps to convert the predicted irradiances to PV power. Finally, regional power forecasts are derived by up-scaling from a representative set of PV systems. The investigation of proper up-scaling is a special focus of this paper. We introduce a modified up-scaling approach, modelling the spatial distribution of the nominal power with a resolution of 1° × 1°. The operational PV power prediction system is evaluated in comparison to the modified up-scaling approach for the control areas of the two German transmission system operators ‘transpower’ and ‘50 Hertz’ for the period 2.7.2009–30.4.2010. rmse values of the operational forecasts are in the range of 4–5% with respect to the nominal power for intra-day and day-ahead forecast horizons. Further improvement is achieved with the modified up-scaling approach. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The data base includes the performance predicted at the design stage, as well as supplementary information obtained by questionnaire from the residents. 220 residences yielded sufficiently complete and reliable data to permit weather correction to be carried out by PRISM software. The results show, on average, fairly close agreement between the observed consumption C(tot,obs) and the consumption C(tot,the) (predicted according to the French procedure), although with some tendency towards overconsumption (or underprediction), C(tot,obs) being 6\% higher than C(tot,the). Among individual consumers there is much scatter, especially for apartments. Characterized in terms of the r.m.s. variation of the ratio C(tot,obs)/C(tot,the), the scatter is 0.3 for single-family residences and 0.5 for apartments. The scatter appears to be mostly due to behavioural effects, as suggested by the large variation (almost 2 to 1) between highest and lowest consumption in a group of six identical row houses. A detailed comparison between predicted and observed PRISM parameters (heating slope, base level and balance temperature) is presented for a subset of 82 single-family houses where the uncertainties are sufficiently small. Most of the overconsumption arises from differences between predicted and observed values of the base level (hot water and cooking), whereas for space heating prediction and observation agree within one percent. An attempt to correlate the ratio C(tot,obs)/C(tot,the) with data from the questionnaire has remained inconclusive for the most part.},

Two short-term transition target years in the process towards this goal are analysed for 2015 and 2030. The energy systems are analysed and designed with hour-by-hour energy system analyses. The analyses reveal that implementing energy savings, renewable energy and more efficient conversion technologies can have positive socio-economic effects, create employment and potentially lead to large earnings on exports. If externalities such as health effects are included, even more benefits can be expected. 100% Renewable energy systems will be technically possible in the future, and may even be economically beneficial compared to the business-as-usual energy system. Hence, the current debate between leaders should reflect a combination of these two main challenges.},

Preheating of the ventilation air within the facade is through incident solar radiation heating of the PV elements and subsequent heat transmission to the air within the ventilation gap. The warmed air can be used for building heating in winter. Modelled and measured air temperatures are found to be in good agreement. The heating and cooling loads for the building with and without such a ventilated facade have been calculated and the impact of climatic variations on the performance such buildings has also been investigated. It was found that the cooling loads are marginally higher with the PV facade for all locations considered, whereas the impact of the facade on the heating load depends critically on location.

  abstract  = {The paper analyses the economic value of using electric heat boilers and heat pumps as wind power integration measures relieving the link between the heat and power production in combined heat and power plants. Both measures have different technical and economic characteristics, making a comparison of the value of these measures relevant. A stochastic, fundamental bottom-up model, taking the stochastic nature of wind power production explicitly into account when making dispatch decisions, is used to analyse the technical and economical performance of these measures in a North European power system covering Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden. Introduction of heat pumps or electric boilers is beneficial for the integration of wind power, because the curtailment of wind power production is reduced, the price of regulating power is reduced and the number of hours with very low power prices is reduced, making the wind power production more valuable. The system benefits of heat pumps and electric boilers are connected to replacing heat production on fuel oil heat boilers and combined heat and power (CHP) plants using various fuels with heat production using electricity and thereby saving fuel. The benefits of the measures depend highly on the underlying structure of heat production. The integration measures are economical, especially in systems where the marginal heat production costs before the introduction of the heat measures are high, e.g. heat production on heat boilers using fuel oil.

The structure of the model is very flexible because the mean prices in the two regimes and the two transition probabilities are functions of the load and/or the implicit reserve margin. Using price data from the single settlement market in \{PJM\} (May 1999 to May 2000), the results show that the estimated switching probability from the low to the high regime predicts price spikes well if the reserve margin is measured accurately. },

  abstract  = {Accurate solar irradiance data are not only of particular importance for the assessment of the radiative forcing of the climate system, but also absolutely necessary for efficient planning and operation of solar energy systems. Within the European project Heliosat-3, a new type of solar irradiance scheme is developed. This new type will be based on radiative transfer models (RTM) using atmospheric parameter information retrieved from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite (clouds, ozone, water vapour) and the ERS-2/ENVISAT satellites (aerosols, ozone). This paper focuses on the description of the clear-sky module of the new scheme, especially on the integrated use of a radiative transfer model. The linkage of the clear-sky module with the cloud module is also briefly described in order to point out the benefits of the integrated RTM use for the all-sky situations. The integrated use of an RTM within the new Solar Irradiance Scheme SOLIS is applied by introducing a new fitting function called the modified LambertâBeer (MLB) relation. Consequently, the modified LambertâBeer relation and its role for an integrated RTM use are discussed. Comparisons of the calculated clear-sky irradiances with ground-based measurements and the current clear-sky module demonstrate the advantages and benefits of SOLIS. Since SOLIS can provide spectrally resolved irradiance data, it can be used for different applications. Beside improved information for the planning of solar energy systems, the calculation of photosynthetic active radiation, UV index, and illuminance is possible.},

This paper examines the thermal dynamics of PCM wallboard that is subjected to the diurnal variation of room temperature, but is not directly illuminated by the sun. The purpose of this work is to provide guidelines useful in selecting an optimal PCM and in estimating the benefits of PCM architectural products. The energy stored during a daily cycle depends upon a) the melt temperature of the PCM; b) the temperature range over which melt occurs; and c) the latent capacity per unit area of wallboard. Situations with the wallboard on an interior partition or on the inside of the building envelope are investigated separately. The following findings are presented. The maximum diurnal energy storage occurs at a value of the PCM melt temperature that is close to the average room temperature in most circumstances. Diurnal energy storage decreases if the phase change transition occurs over a range of temperatures. The diurnal storage achieved in practice may be limited to the range 300-400 kJ/m(2), even if the wallboard has a greater latent capacity. The implications of these findings for test room experiments are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The rapid dissemination of residential water end-use (e.g. shower, clothes washer, etc.) consumption data to the customer via a web-enabled portal interface is becoming feasible through the advent of high resolution smart metering technologies. However, in order to achieve this paradigm shift in residential customer water use feedback, an automated approach for disaggregating complex water flow trace signatures into a registry of end-use event categories needs to be developed. This outcome is achieved by applying a hybrid combination of gradient vector filtering, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm (DTW) techniques on an existing residential water end-use database of 252 households located in South-east Queensland, Australia having high resolution water meters (0.0139 L/pulse), remote data transfer loggers (5 s logging) and completed household water appliance audits. The approach enables both single independent events (e.g. shower event) and combined events (i.e. several overlapping single events) to be disaggregated from flow data into a comprehensive end-use event registry. Complex blind source separation of concurrently occurring water end use events (e.g. shower and toilet flush occurring in same time period) is the primary focus of this present study. Validation of the developed model is achieved through an examination of 50 independent combined events. },

We suggest generalizations, founded on smoothing techniques, applicable for structural identification of non-linear time series models. A similar generalization of the sample cross correlation function is discussed. Furthermore, a measure of the departure from linearity is suggested. It is shown how bootstrapping can be applied to construct confidence intervals under independence or linearity. The generalizations do not prescribe a particular smoothing technique. In fact, when the smoother is replaced by a linear regression the generalizations reduce to close approximations of SACF and SPACF. For this reason a smooth transition from the linear to the non-linear case can be obtained by varying the bandwidth of a local linear smoother. By adjusting the flexibility of the smoother, the power of the tests for independence and linearity against specific alternatives can be adjusted. The generalizations allow for graphical presentations, very similar to those used for SACF and SPACF. In this paper the generalizations are applied to some simulated data sets and to the Canadian lynx data. The generalizations seem to perform well and the measure of the departure from linearity proves to be an important additional tool.},

  abstract  = {For operational planning it is important to provide information about the situation-dependent uncertainty of a wind power forecast. Factors which influence the uncertainty of a wind power forecast include the predictability of the actual meteorological situation, the level of the predicted wind speed (due to the non-linearity of the power curve) and the forecast horizon. With respect to the predictability of the actual meteorological situation a number of explanatory variables are considered, some inspired by the literature. The article contains an overview of related work within the field. An existing wind power forecasting system (Zephyr/WPPT) is considered and it is shown how analysis of the forecast error can be used to build a model of the quantiles of the forecast error. Only explanatory variables or indices which are predictable are considered, whereby the model obtained can be used for providing situation-dependent information regarding the uncertainty. Finally, the article contains directions enabling the reader to replicate the methods and thereby extend other forecast systems with situation-dependent information on uncertainty.

  Abstract                 = {We consider wind power forecasts based on a number of different meteorological forecasts originating from three different global meteorological models. Wind power forecasts based on these meteorological forecasts have fairly similar performance. However, in the paper, we show that the wind power forecast errors are relatively uncorrelated. For this reason, we can combine the forecasts and obtain a final forecast which performs better than any of the individual forecasts. Optimal weights are found based on the bias of the individual forecasts and the variance–covariance matrix of the individual forecast errors. In the paper, we show that quite significant improvements can be obtained using only a few different meteorological forecasts. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

These are considered both without measurement noise and with measurement noise, where the discretely observed stochastic differential equations are embedded in a continuous-discrete time state space model. Every attempts has been made to include results from other scientific disciplines. Maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in nonlinear stochastic differential equations is in general not possible due to the unavailability of closed form expressions for the transition and stationary probability density functions of the states. However, major developments are classified according to their approximation to the “true” maximum likelihood solution as opposed to a historical order of presentation. },

This study seeks to validate, and therefore improve \{GHI\} forecasts. Ground-based data from Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) stations are used in a \{JMA\} mesoscale model (MSM) during the time period from 2008 to 2012 and temporal and spatial characteristics of forecast errors are analyzed. Statistical monthly evaluations show that associated errors vary between seasons, with monthly \{GHI\} mean bias error values ranging from −60 to +45&#xa0;W/m2 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranging from 95 to 170&#xa0;W/m2. Mapping of forecast errors show that underestimation of \{GHI\} forecast values and large \{RMSE\} values are significant in the southern part of Japan (a subtropical region located along the Pacific Ocean), particularly during summers. In winter, overestimation of \{GHI\} forecasts is found throughout the entire Japanese archipelago. The frequency of different cloud type occurrences over the Japanese islands indicate that regional and seasonal variations in cloud types are related to relatively large \{GHI\} forecast errors. High-level cirrus clouds, mid-level altocumulus, and low-level stratus are often observed during summer, when forecasted values are underestimated, and during winter, when values are overestimated. },

One way to overcome these problems is to move consumption to times where wind power otherwise cause overproduction and large fluctuations in prices. The paper presents a method which takes advantage of heat capacity in single-family houses using heat pumps which are anticipated to be installed in large numbers in Denmark in next decade. This type of heating gives a large time constant and it is shown possible to move consumption without compromising the comfort of house residents. In the paper an optimization exploiting forecasts of weather and energy prices combined with prediction models of house dynamics is presented. The results show that with the presented method it will be possible to move a substantial amount of energy from one time to another.},

  abstract  = {Hourly solar and photovoltaic (PV) forecasts for horizons between 0 and 48 h ahead were developed using Environment Canada's Global Environmental Multiscale model. The motivation for this research was to explore PV forecasting in Ontario, Canada, where feed-in tariffs are driving rapid growth in installed PV capacity. The solar and PV forecasts were compared with irradiance data from 10 North-American ground stations and with alternating current power data from three Canadian PV systems. A 1-year period was used to train the forecasts, and the following year was used for testing. Two post-processing methods were applied to the solar forecasts: spatial averaging and bias removal using a Kalman filter. On average, these two methods lead to a 43% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) over a persistence forecast (skill score = 0.67) and to a 15% reduction in RMSE over the Global Environmental Multiscale forecasts without post-processing (skill score = 0.28). Bias removal was primarily useful when considering a “regional” forecast for the average irradiance of the 10 ground stations because bias was a more significant fraction of RMSE in this case. PV forecast accuracy was influenced mainly by the underlying (horizontal) solar forecast accuracy, with RMSE ranging from 6.4% to 9.2% of rated power for the individual PV systems. About 76% of the PV forecast errors were within ±5% of the rated power for the individual systems, but the largest errors reached up to 44% to 57% of rated power. © HerMajesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2011.

  Abstract                 = {Short-term load forecasting (STLF) has become an essential tool in the electricity sector. It has been classically object of vast research since energy load prediction is known to be non-linear. In a previous work, we focused on non-residential building STLF, an special case of STLF where weather has negligible influence on the load. Now we tackle more modern buildings in which the temperature does alter its energy consumption. This is, we address here fully-HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning) ones. Still, in this problem domain, the forecasting method selected must be simple, without tedious trial-and-error configuring or parametrising procedures, work with scarce (or any) training data and be able to predict an evolving demand curve. Following our preceding research, we have avoided the inherent non-linearity by using the work day schedule as day-type classifier. We have evaluated the most popular STLF systems in the literature, namely ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) time series and Neural networks (NN), together with an Autoregressive Model (AR) time series and a Bayesian network (BN), concluding that the autoregressive time series outperforms its counterparts and suffices to fulfil the addressed requirements, even in a 6 day-ahead horizon.},

  abstract  = {The objective is to characterise the solar collector during a relatively short testing period with no requirement for steady state climatic conditions. This information is then used for predicting annual performance of the collector. A standard collector model that is compatible with the ISO 9806-1 test standard is used with correction terms for beam and diffuse incidence angle modifiers, thermal capacitance, wind speed and sky temperature. This results in a more complete characterisation of the collector. The collector parameters are identified by multiple linear regression, MLR. The method has been tested for characterisation of unglazed collectors, glazed flat plate collectors, evacuated tubular collectors, CPC collectors and concentrating collectors with satisfying results. Typically the correlation coefficient R2 is better than 0.99 and the standard deviation of the difference between model and measurement is in the range 3-10 W/m2. In the original method the angular dependence of the optical efficiency and the temperature dependence of the heat losses are supposed to be adjusted to a predetermined function. The most recent development is a routine that makes it possible to accurately identify non-linear optical and thermal performance. This extended MLR method can identify the zero loss efficiency for every angle of incidence interval and the temperature dependent heat losses for every temperature interval. This opens the application of the method to collectors with special incidence angle and heat loss effects that cannot be described easily with a combination of elementary functions. Instead a table of parameter values is determined, which is used directly in standard simulation programmes. This method will further increase the accuracy when comparing different collector designs. It has been used for comparing different glazings and for comparison with spectrophotometric measurements. It has also been used for analysing the heat loss factors for Teflon and honeycomb glazings. Since the total power output of the collector is less dependent on the heat loss coefficient than on the optical efficiency the scattering in this data is larger than for the incidence angle curves. The reflectance of booster mirrors cannot be derived with the MLR-method with acceptable accuracy. The correlation between direct irradiance and irradiance from the reflector exhibit a very strong correlation. Instead the effective reflectance of the mirror can be estimated by comparison of the measured output with calculation by the complete collector and reflector model. This effective reflectance is not compatible with the specular reflectance obtained from spectrophotometric measurements caused by large differences in acceptance angles. Standard multiple linear regression available in most spread sheet and statistical programs can be used for the parameter identification in the extended MLR-procedure. The identification takes only a few seconds. At the AÌlvkarleby Laboratory the test method is now used as a routine tool for the evaluation of new collector materials and designs. The Swedish National testing institute has evaluated the methods with the conclusion that they have a potential for being used in standardised collector testing.},

  abstract    = {Solar Combi systems still need quite a lot of auxiliary energy especially in small systems without seasonal storage possibilities. The control of the auxiliary energy input both in time and power is important to utilize as much as possible of the solar energy available from the collectors and also to use low backup energy prices during the day if electricity is used. The storage function and both stratified charging and extraction of heat, are very important, to separate different temperature zones in the storage. This paper describes a step towards forecast control for electricity based auxiliary energy sources. It can be either direct electric heating elements or a heat pump upgrading ambient energy in the air, ground, solar collector or waste heat from the house. The paper describes system modeling and simulation results. Advanced laboratory experiments are also starting now with three different combisystems, operating in parallel. These systems will be briefly described too.},

Basically they aim at setting minimum energy efficiency requirements to achieve energy efficient design in new buildings.

The paper focuses on the synthesis of energy efficiency requirements on \{HVAC\} systems of non-residential buildings in different regulations. Critical issues for the development of prescriptive and performance regulatory paths for this type of systems in non-residential buildings are discussed in order to improve the understanding of \{HVAC\} energy efficiency topics and to provide policy makers with a menu of options to strengthen the \{HVAC\} section of building energy codes. },

  Abstract                 = {Energy certification schemes for buildings emerged in the early 1990s as an essential method for improving energy efficiency, minimising energy consumption and enabling greater transparency with regards to the use of energy in buildings. However, from the beginning their definition and implementation process were diffuse and, occasionally, have confused building sector stakeholders. A multiplicity of terms and concepts such as energy performance, energy efficiency, energy ratings, benchmarking, labelling, etc., have emerged with sometimes overlapping meanings. This has frequently led to misleading interpretations by regulatory bodies, energy agencies and final consumers. This paper analyses the origin and the historic development of energy certification schemes in buildings along with the definition and scope of a building energy certificate and critical aspects of its implementation. Concepts such as benchmarking tools, energy ratings and energy labelling are clarified within the wider topic of certification schemes. Finally, a seven steps process is proposed as a guide for implementing building energy certification. },

  abstract  = {Due to the fluctuating nature of the wind resource, a wind power producer participating in a liberalized electricity market is subject to penalties related to regulation costs. Accurate forecasts of wind generation are therefore paramount for reducing such penalties and thus maximizing revenue. Despite the fact that increasing accuracy in spot forecasts may reduce penalties, this paper shows that, if such forecasts are accompanied with information on their uncertainty, i.e., in the form of predictive distributions, then this can be the basis for defining advanced strategies for market participation. Such strategies permit to further increase revenues and thus enhance competitiveness of wind generation compared to other forms of dispatchable generation. This paper formulates a general methodology for deriving optimal bidding strategies based on probabilistic forecasts of wind generation, as well as on modeling of the sensitivity a wind power producer may have to regulation costs. The benefits resulting from the application of these strategies are clearly demonstrated on the test case of the participation of a multi-MW wind farm in the Dutch electricity market over a year.},

  abstract  = {Predictions of wind power production for horizons up to 48–72 h ahead comprise a highly valuable input to the methods for the daily management or trading of wind generation. Today, users of wind power predictions are not only provided with point predictions, which are estimates of the conditional expectation of the wind generation for each look-ahead time, but also with uncertainty estimates given by probabilistic forecasts. In order to avoid assumptions on the shape of predictive distributions, these probabilistic predictions are produced from non-parametric methods, and then take the form of a single or a set of quantile forecasts. The required and desirable properties of such probabilistic forecasts are defined and a framework for their evaluation is proposed. This framework is applied for evaluating the quality of two statistical methods producing full predictive distributions from point predictions of wind power. These distributions are defined by a number of quantile forecasts with nominal proportions spanning the unit interval. The relevance and interest of the introduced evaluation framework are discussed.

Accurate forecasting of the water temperature at critical points is crucial for meeting constraints related to consumers while minimizing the production costs for the heat supplier. A new forecasting methodology based on conditional finite impulse response (cFIR) models is introduced, for which model coefficients are replaced by coefficient functions of the water flux at the supply point and of the time of day, allowing for nonlinear variations of the time delays. Appropriate estimation methods for both are described. Results are given for the test case of the Roskilde district heating system over a period of more than 6 years. The advantages of the proposed forecasting methodology in terms of a higher forecast accuracy, its use for simulation purposes, or alternatively for better understanding transfer functions of district heating systems, are clearly shown.},

As buildings account for about 40&#xa0;% of global final energy use, efficient building climate control can significantly contribute to the saving effort. Predictive building automation can be used to operate buildings in an energy and cost effective manner with minimum retrofitting requirements. In such a predictive control approach, dynamic building models are of crucial importance for a good control performance. An algorithm which has not been used in building modeling yet, namely a combination of minimization of multi-step ahead prediction errors and partial least squares will be investigated. Subsequently, two case studies are presented: the first is an artificial model of a building constructed in Trnsys environment, while the second is a real-life case study. The proposed identification algorithm is then validated and tested. },

This strategy exploits the heat capacity of the building itself; it can be implemented at low cost and without sacrifice of comfort. To evaluate the strategy for a given building and to control the thermostat, one needs to know the thermal behaviour of the building. Building temperature, internal load and solar data are used to determine a small number of thermal parameters which characterize the building. Several thermostat control strategies, distinguished by their knowledge of the building dynamics, are described and simulated, with a data-based dynamic model. Universal graphs for effective storage capacity and storage efficiency are developed. A simple economic analysis shows that subcooling is likely to be cost-effective for many commercial buildings, with current electric rate schedules.},

Using occupancy rate as proxy for the operating mode of the building and its HVAC system, the model is generalized by doubling the number of parameters and distinguishing two types of day, occupied and unoccupied. This approach is tested with measured consumption data for some fifty commercial buildings. The results show that occupancy data can bring appreciable improvement in the accuracy of the model. However, the interpretation of the individual parameters, such as slope and balance point temperature, should be undertaken with great caution. Due to various biases the discrepancy between the parameters identified by an energy signature model and the true values can differ by far more than the standard errors indicated by the regression. Such biases are particularly important in commercial buildings, as we demonstrate with several examples.},

  abstract  = {The residential air-conditioning load is a significant component of electric utility peak demand, which typically occurs on very hot summer afternoons. Efforts by utilities to shave or shift air-conditioning demand to off-peak periods in the day have been spurred by low-cost electronics and include such strategies as direct-load control and price-induced local control by homeowners. We propose alternative practical strategies of peak shaving that use the opportunities offered by modern electronics as well as a more intelligent use of the thermal mass storage inherent in the structure and furnishings of the house. Using the framework of a simplified electrical analogue, we predict the thermal performance of the residence when the air-conditioner is switched off and illustrate the validity of such simplified estimates with monitored data from an actual residence. Finally, we discuss practical aspects related to the implementation of these strategies, particularly as to what is needed in terms of electronic sophistication of the thermostat.},

Utilizable energy is the radiation above a specified threshold level. Differences between the utilizable energy measured and the utilizable energy predicted are observed for various surface slope/azimuth orientations and critical radiation levels. Normalized root mean square difference and normalized mean bias difference statistics are formed to quantify the ability of each model to estimate the utilizable energy on a tilted surface. The influence of horizontal diffuse radiation on tilted surface model performance is examined by comparing the predicted utilizable energy on a tilted surface using both measured horizontal diffuse and estimated horizontal diffuse found from diffuse fraction correlations. On an overall basis, the isotropic sky model showed the poorest performance and is not recommended for estimating the hourly radiation on a tilted surface. The anisotropic models have comparable performance to each other. There was no significant degradation of tilted surface model performance when the diffuse radiation is estimated from a diffuse fraction correlation rather than obtained from measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The integration of buildings in a Smart Grid, enabling demand-side management and thermal storage, requires robust reduced-order building models that allow for the development and evaluation of demand-side management control strategies. To develop such models for existing buildings, with often unknown the thermal properties, data-driven system identification methods are proposed. In this paper, system identification is carried out to identify suitable reduced-order models. Therefore, grey-box models of increasing complexity are identified on results from simulations with a detailed physical model, deployed in the integrated district energy assessment simulation (IDEAS) package in Modelica. Firstly, the robustness of identified grey-box models for day-ahead predictions and simulations of the thermal response of a dwelling, as well as the physical interpretation of the identified parameters, are analyzed. The influence of the identification dataset is quantified, comparing the added value of dedicated identification experiments against identification on data from in use buildings. Secondly, the influence of the data used for identification on model performance and the reliability of the parameter estimates is quantified. Both alternative measurements and the influence of noise on the data are considered. },

It is also a certainty that the potential for energy conservation in the existing buildings is very large, and there is a need for a rating of their energy performance. Facing this problem and the lack of tools, we chose to develop a measurement based approach, often referred to as an identification method. The principle of this method is to derive the thermal behavior from a continuous recording of internal temperature within the building in response to outdoor climate (temperature and solar radiation) and internal loads (heating and appliances). The derived parameters are then used to calculate a normalized heating annual consumption (NHAC) for a standard climate and a standard operation of the building (set point temperature, air change rate and casual gains). The paper presents the proposed methodology for single family houses, including the experimental equipment, the monitoring protocol and the calculation tool. Results are also discussed for a set of 10 monitored houses within Europe. Although some limitations of the methodology were found, that will require deeper investigations, the NHAC was found a robust indicator to deal with occupants' influence.

This ESRA model is described and analysed with the main objective of being used to estimate solar radiation at ground level from satellite images with the Heliosat method. Therefore it is compared to clear-sky models that have already been used in the Heliosat method. The diffuse clear-sky irradiation estimated by this ESRA model and by other models has been also checked against ground measurements, for different ranges of the Linke turbidity factor and solar elevation. The results show that the ESRA model is the best one with respect to robustness and accuracy. The r.m.s. error in the estimation of the hourly diffuse irradiation ranges from 11 Wh mâ2 to 35 Wh mâ2 for diffuse irradiation up to 250 Wh mâ2. The good results obtained with such a model are due to the fact that it takes into account the Linke turbidity factor and the elevation of the site, two factors that influence the incoming solar radiation. In return, it implies the knowledge of these factors at each pixel of the satellite image for the application of the Heliosat method.},

In a first part, the 21 stations were grouped into seven subregions (corresponding to seven different climatic regions) and all the models were locally-fitted and evaluated using these seven datasets. Results showed that the new proposed model provides slightly better estimates. Particularly, this new model provides a relative root mean square error in the range 25â35\% and a relative mean bias error in the range â15\% to 15\%, depending on the region. In a second part, the potential global character of the new model was evaluated. To this end, the model was fitted using the whole dataset. Results showed that the global fitting model provides overall better estimates that the locally-fitted models, with relative root mean square error values ranging 20â35\% and a relative mean bias error ranging â5\% to â12\%. Additionally, the new proposed model showed some advantages compared to other evaluated models. Particularly, the sigmoid behaviour of this model is able to provide physically reliable estimates for extreme values of the clearness index even though using less parameter than other tested models.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this thesis is to contribute to the research in forecasting energy consumption in residential houses. The work is motivated by the Danish iPower project, which deals with investigation of possibilities for replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy. Renewable energy in Denmark is mostly based on wind power which is a highly fluctuating energy source and it is difficult to conserve. Energy consumption is also varying but independent of supply to the power plant. The fact that energy supply and energy consumption is not synchronized could be handled with a methodology that facilitates using the energy when present. The present work provides an adaptive method to get detailed knowledge of the energy consumption in residential houses. The method will be a contribution to forecasting energy consumption and to the development of Smart Grid technology. The approach taken is to reveal the details in the heating consumption in residential houses by developing mathematical models for the heat load. Based on district heating consumption data from four houses in a small area in Denmark and data from a nearby meteorological station, models are developed for separating the heating signals into different components. One of the models is able to split the overall consumption into heating consumption and hot water consumption. The heating consumption is further separated into parts explained by diurnal variation and variation explained by changes in outdoor temperature and the amount of solar radiation present. The method is adaptive to changes in the consumption due to variation in the daily routine of the inhabitants. The results are obtained by using mathematical modeling, statistics and time series analysis. For separating the hot water consumption and heating Low Pass Filters and advanced Kernel Smoothing techniques are used. The Kernel Smoother is extended to contain robust estimation and polynomial shape kernels. The further separation of the heating consumption is done with Kalman Filter techniques for signal separation.},

In contrary, this paper presents a general methodology of minimizing energy consumption using current energy sources and minimal retrofitting, but instead making use of advanced control techniques. We focus on the analysis of energy savings that can be achieved in a building heating system by applying model predictive control (MPC) and using weather predictions. The basic formulation of MPC is described with emphasis on the building control application and tested in a two months experiment performed on a real building in Prague, Czech Republic.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A Markov-switching model in wind speed forecasting is examined in this research. The proposed method employs a regime switching process governed by a discrete-state Markov chain to model the nonlinear evolvement of the wind speed time-series. A Bayesian inference rather than the traditional maximum likelihood estimation is applied to evaluate the parameters of the Markov-switching model. Unlike the traditional point forecast of wind speeds, the Markov-switching model can offer both of the point and interval wind speed forecast. To examine the forecasting performance of the Markov-switching model, four wind speed forecasting models, the persistent model, the autoregressive model, the neural networks model, and the Bayesian structural break model, are employed as baselines. Wind speed data collected from utility-scale wind turbines are utilized for the model development and the computational results demonstrate that the Markov-switching model is promising in wind speed forecasting. },

By wavelet transform, the historical price series is decomposed and reconstructed into one approximation series and some detail series.

The thermal, hydraulic, energy and control performances of the system are simulated. The on-line control strategies (i.e. adaptive and derivative strategies) developed for the central chilling system are tested and evaluated by applying them to control the simulated living chilling system under different AHU dynamic loads.

  abstract                   = {Based on polynomial s-transfer functions of transient heat conduction through a building construction, a novel and simple model is developed for building thermal load calculation. The polynomial s-transfer functions are estimated from the theoretical frequency responses of the building construction by frequency-domain regression method. The simple polynomial s-transfer functions are completely equivalent to the hyperbolic s-transfer functions in terms of frequency characteristics. First, the frequency responses of the total transmission matrix are calculated within the frequency range concerned. Then, a set of linear equations is solved yielding a simple polynomial s-transfer function for cross and internal heat conduction. Finally, simple recursive formulae are obtained by inverse Laplace transforms and discretization of the convolution integrals. The coefficients of the model are independent from time step and the time step can be varied according to the requirement during simulation. Validations and comparisons show that this model has fast computation speed and no numerical unstability, and provides high accuracy and good flexibility to the requirement of variable time step.

  abstract  = {Time-use data, describing in detail the everyday life of household members as high-resolved activity sequences, have a largely unrealized potential of contributing to domestic energy demand modelling. A model for computation of daily electricity and hot-water demand profiles from time-use data was developed, using simple conversion schemes, mean appliance and water-tap data and general daylight availability distributions. Validation against detailed, end-use specific electricity measurements in a small sample of households reveals that the model for household electricity reproduces hourly load patterns with preservation of important qualitative features. The output from the model, when applied to a large data set of time use in Sweden, also shows correspondence to aggregate profiles for both household electricity and hot water from recent Swedish measurement surveys. Deviations on individual household level are predominantly due to occasionally ill-reported time-use data and on aggregate population level due to slightly non-representative samples. Future uses and developments are identified and it is suggested that modelling energy use from time-use data could be an alternative, or a complement, to energy demand measurements in households. },

There is thus a need for taking measurements of solar irradiation and creating local and regional databases of irradiation and synoptic (meteorological) information. However, there is no guarantee of the quality of the data collected, as often due care is not exercised with respect to quality control of the measured dataset. This article reviews the presently available procedures for quality assessment of the solar irradiation data. Furthermore, we propose a set of stringent physical and statistical measures to create a semi-automated procedure that is based on the creation of an envelope in the clearness indexâdiffuse to global irradiance ratio domain. The procedure is very general in nature and may be used with equal effectiveness for any terrestrial dataset.},

The regressive solar radiation module predicts the solar radiation using the forecasted cloud amount, sky condition and extreme temperatures from on-line weather stations, while the forecasted sky condition is used to correct the cloud amount forecast. The temperature/relative humidity prediction module uses a dynamic grey model (GM), which is specialized in the grey system with incomplete information.

This paper presents a non-parametric machine learning approach used for multi-site prediction of solar power generation on a forecast horizon of one to six hours. Historical power generation and relevant meteorological variables related to 42 individual \{PV\} rooftop installations are used to train a gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) model. When compared to single-site linear autoregressive and variations of \{GBRT\} models the multi-site model shows competitive results in terms of root mean squared error on all forecast horizons. The predictive performance and the simplicity of the model setup make the boosted tree model a simple and attractive compliment to conventional forecasting techniques. },

Short term load forecast of such consumers has a strong potential to contribute to the improvement of the overall system efficiency. This work investigates the performance of recursive least squares for predicting the heat load of individual greenhouses in an online manner. Predictor inputs (weekly curves terms and weather forecast inputs) are selected in an automated manner using a forward selection approach. Historical load measurements from 5 Danish greenhouses with different operational characteristics were used, together with weather measurements and a weather forecast service. It was found that these predictors of reduced complexity and computational load performed well at capturing recurring load profiles, but not fast frequency random changes. Overall, the root mean square error of the prediction was within 8â20% of the peak load for the set of consumers over the 8 months period considered. },

The building is controlled by one central server, where among other things it is possible to record temperature in each room, and implement control of the installed electrical heaters. Furthermore a climate station is located right next to the building. The objective of the experiments is to provide data for models of the thermal dynamics of the building. The designs of the experiments is such that the conditions are during the experiments, from conditions optimized for modelling toward more common living conditions, i.e. from high variation of the indoor temperature, toward thermostatic temperature control and human activities in the building. In total five experiments have been successfully carried out, two with PRBS signals controlling the heaters, and three with thermostatic control.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a new approach to online forecasting of power production from PV systems. The method is suited to online forecasting in many applications and in this paper it is used to predict hourly values of solar power for horizons of up to 36h. The data used is 15-min observations of solar power from 21 PV systems located on rooftops in a small village in Denmark. The suggested method is a two-stage method where first a statistical normalization of the solar power is obtained using a clear sky model. The clear sky model is found using statistical smoothing techniques. Then forecasts of the normalized solar power are calculated using adaptive linear time series models. Both autoregressive (AR) and AR with exogenous input (ARX) models are evaluated, where the latter takes numerical weather predictions (NWPs) as input. The results indicate that for forecasts up to 2h ahead the most important input is the available observations of solar power, while for longer horizons NWPs are the most important input. A root mean square error improvement of around 35% is achieved by the ARX model compared to a proposed reference model.},

  abstract  = {An accurate forecast of solar irradiation is required for various solar energy applications and environmental impact analyses in recent years. Comparatively, various irradiation forecast models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) perform much better in accuracy than many conventional prediction models. However, the forecast precision of most existing ANN based forecast models has not been satisfactory to researchers and engineers so far, and the generalization capability of these networks needs further improving. Combining the prominent dynamic properties of a recurrent neural network (RNN) with the enhanced ability of a wavelet neural network (WNN) in mapping nonlinear functions, a diagonal recurrent wavelet neural network (DRWNN) is newly established in this paper to perform fine forecasting of hourly and daily global solar irradiance. Some additional steps, e.g. applying historical information of cloud cover to sample data sets and the cloud cover from the weather forecast to network input, are adopted to help enhance the forecast precision. Besides, a specially scheduled two phase training algorithm is adopted. As examples, both hourly and daily irradiance forecasts are completed using sample data sets in Shanghai and Macau, and comparisons between irradiation models show that the DRWNN models are definitely more accurate.},

The decomposition of the global solar irradiance into a deterministic clear sky component and a stochastic cloud cover component is achieved through a parameterization process. The cloud cover time series is modeled by a Box-Jenkins-type ARIMA model and forecasts issued hourly for specified interval periods throughout the hour. Results show that when compared to actual data measured at several locations in the southeastern United States, the forecasts are quite accurate and the model is site-independent. Forecasts are found to be inaccurate only when there are sudden changes in the cloud cover moving across the sun. In other words, the randomness involved in sudden extreme changes in the sun's intensity during a single interval will not be picked up by the forecast model and is generally considered impossible to predict by any forecast model. One of the many application of the forecast methodology is to dispatch photovoltaic power output in the optimal power dispatch scheme of electric utilities.},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with mathematical modelling of the heat transfer of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules.The efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) module and its temperature are negatively correlated. It is therefore of interest to lower the temperature of the PV module by increasing the heat transfer from the PV module. The experiment and data originate from a test reference module the EC-JRC Ispra. The set-up provides the opportunity of changing physical parameters, the ventilation speed and the type of air flow, and this makes it possible to determine the preferable set-up.To identify best set-up, grey-box models consisting of stochastic differential equations are applied. The models are first order stochastic state space models. Maximum likelihood estimation and the extended Kalman filter are applied in the parameter estimation phase. To validate the estimated models, plots of the residuals and autocorrelation functions of the residuals are analyzed.The analysis has revealed that it is necessary to use non-linear state space models in order to obtain a satisfactory description of the PV module temperature, and in order to be able to distinguish the variations in the set-up. The heat transfer is increased when the forced ventilation velocity is increased, while the change in type of air flow does not have as striking influence. The residual analysis show that the best description of the PV module temperature is obtained when fins, disturbing the laminar flow and making it turbulent, are applied in the set-up combined with high level of air flow. The improved description by the model is mainly seen in periods with high solar radiation.},

A two-dimensional (2-D) representation model of the hourly solar radiation data is proposed. The model provides a unique and compact visualization of the data for inspection, and enables accurate forecasting using image processing methods. Using the hourly solar radiation data mentioned above, the image model is formed in raster scan form with rows and columns corresponding to days and hours, respectively. Logically, the between-day correlations along the same hour segment provide the vertical correlations of the image, which is not available in the regular 1-D representation. To test the forecasting efficiency of the model, nine different linear filters with various filter-tap configurations are optimized and tested. The results provide the necessary correlation model and prediction directions for obtaining the optimum prediction template for forecasting. Next, the 2-D forecasting performance is tested through feed-forward neural networks (NN) using the same data. The optimal linear filters and NN models are compared in the sense of root mean square error (RMSE). It is observed that the 2-D model has pronounced advantages over the 1-D representation for both linear and NN prediction methods. Due to the capability of depicting the nonlinear behavior of the input data, the NN models are found to achieve better forecasting results than linear prediction filters in both 1-D and 2-D.},

  abstract  = {This paper focuses on a method for linear or non-linear continuous time modelling of physical systems using discrete time data. This approach facilitates a more appropriate modelling of more realistic non-linear systems. Particularly concerning advanced building components, convective and radiative heat interchanges are non-linear effects and represent significant contributions in a variety of components such as photovoltaic integrated façades or roofs and those using these effects as passive cooling strategies, etc. Since models are approximations of the physical system and data is encumbered with measurement errors it is also argued that it is important to consider stochastic models.More specifically this paper advocates for using continuous-discrete stochastic state space models in the form of non-linear partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDE's)-with measurement noise for modelling dynamic systems in continuous time using discrete time data. First of all the proposed method provides a method for modelling non-linear systems with partially observed states. The approach allows parameters to be estimated from experimental data in a prediction error (PE) setting, which gives less biased and more reproducible results in the presence of significant process noise than the more commonly used output error (OE) setting. To facilitate the use of continuous-discrete stochastic state space models, a PE estimation scheme that features maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is presented along with a software implementation.As a case study, the modelling of the thermal characteristics of a building integrated PV component is considered. The EC-JRC Ispra has made experimental data available. Both linear and non-linear models are identified. It is shown that a description of the non-linear heat transfer is essential. The resulting model is a non-linear first order stochastic differential equation for the heat transfer of the PV component.},

Demonstration of this relationship is given as a test case for the Western Danish price area of the Nord Pool's Elspot market. Impact on the average price behaviour is investigated as well as that on the distributional properties of the price. By using a non-parametric regression model to assess the effects of wind power forecasts on the average behaviour, the non-linearities and time variations in the relationship are captured well and the effects are shown to be quite substantial. Furthermore, by evaluating the distributional properties of the spot prices under different scenarios, the impact of the wind power forecasts on the price distribution is proved to be considerable. The conditional price distribution is moreover shown to be non-Gaussian. This implies that forecasting models for electricity spot prices for which parameters are estimated by a least squares techniques will not have Gaussian residuals. Hence the widespread assumption of Gaussian residuals from electricity spot price models is shown to be inadequate for these model types. The revealed effects are likely to be observable and qualitatively similar in other day-ahead electricity markets significantly penetrated by wind power.},

The framework is based on an interplay between stochastic differential equation modelling, statistical tests and nonparametric modelling and provides features that allow model deficiencies to be pinpointed and their structural origin to be uncovered. More specifically, the proposed framework can be used to obtain estimates of unknown functional relations, in turn allowing unknown or inappropriately modelled phenomena to be uncovered. In this manner the framework permits systematic iterative model improvement. The performance of the proposed framework is illustrated through a case study involving a dynamic model of a fed-batch bioreactor, where it is shown how an inappropriately modelled biomass growth rate can be uncovered and a proper functional relation inferred. A key point illustrated through this case study is that functional relations involving unmeasured variables can also be uncovered.},

The parameters in the continuous-time model are estimated by the maximum likelihood method where a Kalman filter is used in calculating the likelihood function. The modeling procedure is illustrated by using measurements from an experiment where the heat input from electrical heaters is controlled by a pseudorandom binary signal. For the considered building a rather simple model containing two time constants is found adequate. Owing to the continuous-time formulation the parameters of the model are directly physically interpretable. The performance of the model for both forecasting and simulation is illustrated.},

  abstract  = {Due to strong increase of solar power generation, the predictions of incoming solar energy are acquiring more importance. Photovoltaic and solar thermal are the main sources of electricity generation from solar energy. In the case of solar thermal energy plants with storage energy system, its management and operation need reliable predictions of solar irradiance with the same temporal resolution as the temporal capacity of the back-up system. These plants can work like a conventional power plant and compete in the energy stock market avoiding intermittence in electricity production.This work presents a comparisons of statistical models based on time series applied to predict half daily values of global solar irradiance with a temporal horizon of 3 days. Half daily values consist of accumulated hourly global solar irradiance from solar raise to solar noon and from noon until dawn for each day. The dataset of ground solar radiation used belongs to stations of Spanish National Weather Service (AEMet). The models tested are autoregressive, neural networks and fuzzy logic models. Due to the fact that half daily solar irradiance time series is non-stationary, it has been necessary to transform it to two new stationary variables (clearness index and lost component) which are used as input of the predictive models. Improvement in terms of RMSD of the models essayed is compared against the model based on persistence. The validation process shows that all models essayed improve persistence. The best approach to forecast half daily values of solar irradiance is neural network models with lost component as input, except Lerida station where models based on clearness index have less uncertainty because this magnitude has a linear behaviour and it is easier to simulate by models.},

The simplex method and an updating procedure are combined into a new algorithm for time-adaptive quantile regression, which generates new solutions on the basis of the old solution, leading to savings in computation time. The suggested algorithm is tested against a static quantile regression model on a data set with wind power production, where the models combine splines and quantile regression.

Data for the whole day can then be used. A one-node capacitance correction for dynamic effects and separate incidence angle modifiers for direct and diffuse radiation are essential for the accuracy of the method. The model is set up for thermal power output (and not efficiency). This forces the parameters to values that are suitable for prediction of long-term performance. The collector model and parameters correspond closely to those used in existing detailed simulation programs such as TRNSYS, WATSUN, or MINSUN. The method can be used as an accurate bridge between short-term testing and long-term prediction by simulation.},

The problem is examined initially for the univariate case, and is extended to include additional meteorological parameters in the process of estimating the optimum model. The results indicate that the developed artificial intelligence models predict the solar radiation time series more effectively compared to the conventional procedures based on the clearness index. The forecasting ability of some models can be further enhanced with the use of additional meteorological parameters.},

Each test room is divided into thermal zones in order to describe both short and long term variations. Besides modelling the heat transfer between thermal zones, attention is put on modelling the heat input from radiators and solar radiation. The applied modelling procedure is based on collected building performance data and statistical methods. The statistical methods are used in parameter estimation and model validation, while physical knowledge is used in forming the model structure. The suggested lumped parameter model is thus based on thermodynamics and formulated as a system of stochastic differential equations. Due to the continuous time formulation the parameters of the model are directly physical interpretable. Finally, the prediction and simulation performance of the model is illustrated.},

It tabulates the frequencies, over n forecast occasions, of the rank of the MST length for each ensemble, within the group of such lengths that is obtained by substituting an observation for each of its ensemble members in turn. In raw form it is unable to distinguish ensemble bias from ensemble underdispersion, or to discern the contributions of forecast variables with small variance. The use of scaled and debiased MST histograms to diagnose attributes of ensemble forecasts is illustrated, both for synthetic Gaussian ensembles and for a small sample of actual ensemble forecasts. Also presented are adjustments to x 2 critical values for evaluating rank uniformity, for both MST histograms and scalar rank histograms, given serial correlation in the forecasts.},

  abstract  = {Variability of solar resource poses difficulties in grid management as solar penetration rates rise continuously. Thus, the task of solar power forecasting becomes crucial to ensure grid stability and to enable an optimal unit commitment and economical dispatch. Several forecast horizons can be identified, spanning from a few seconds to days or weeks ahead, as well as spatial horizons, from single site to regional forecasts. New techniques and approaches arise worldwide each year to improve accuracy of models with the ultimate goal of reducing uncertainty in the predictions. This paper appears with the aim of compiling a large part of the knowledge about solar power forecasting, focusing on the latest advancements and future trends. Firstly, the motivation to achieve an accurate forecast is presented with the analysis of the economic implications it may have. It is followed by a summary of the main techniques used to issue the predictions. Then, the benefits of point/regional forecasts and deterministic/probabilistic forecasts are discussed. It has been observed that most recent papers highlight the importance of probabilistic predictions and they incorporate an economic assessment of the impact of the accuracy of the forecasts on the grid. Later on, a classification of authors according to forecast horizons and origin of inputs is presented, which represents the most up-to-date compilation of solar power forecasting studies. Finally, all the different metrics used by the researchers have been collected and some remarks for enabling a fair comparison among studies have been stated.},

The growth of solar power penetration in distribution grids imposes the use of solar power forecasts as inputs in advanced grid management functions. This paper proposes a new forecasting algorithm for 6 h ahead based on the vector autoregression framework, which combines distributed time series information collected by the Smart Grid infrastructure. Probabilistic forecasts are generated for the residential solar photovoltaic (PV) and secondary substation levels. The test case consists of 44 micro-generation units and 10 secondary substations from the Smart Grid pilot in Evora, Portugal. The benchmark model is the well-known autoregressive forecasting method (univariate approach). The average improvement in terms of root mean square error (point forecast evaluation) and continuous ranking probability score (probabilistic forecast evaluation) for the first 3 lead-times was between 8% and 12%, and between 1.4% and 5.9%, respectively.

  abstract  = {This work presents an alternative metric for evaluating the quality of solar forecasting models. Some conventional approaches use quantities such as the root-mean-squareerror (RMSE) and/or correlation coefficients to evaluate model quality. The direct use of statistical quantities to assign forecasting quality can be misleading because these metrics do not convey a measure of the variability of the time-series for the solar irradiance data. In contrast, the quality metric proposed here, which is defined as the ratio of solar uncertainty to solar variability, compares the forecasting error with the solar variability directly. By making the forecasting error to variability comparisons for different time windows, we show that this ratio is essentially a statistical invariant for each forecast model employed, i.e., the ratio is preserved for widely different time horizons when the same time averaging periods are used, and therefore provides a robust way to compare solar forecasting skills. We employ the proposed metric to evaluate two new forecasting models proposed here, and compare their performances with a persistence model. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4007496]},

Solar-forecasting methods are classified by technique, time horizon, and application. Advantages and disadvantages of deterministic and stochastic forecasting approaches are laid out and discussed in the context of solar forecasting based on numerical weather prediction, satellite data, and ground measurements. Metrics to evaluate solar-forecasting techniques are then presented and a time horizon-invariant metric is introduced that allows comparing forecast errors across time horizons, geographical regions, and time steps. Finally, the metric is demonstrated with hour-ahead forecasts based on stochastic-learning and satellite cloud-motion vector techniques. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  title    = {Non-parametric method for separating domestic hot water heating spikes and space heating},

  abstract = {In this paper a method for separating spikes from a noisy data series, where the data change and evolve over time, is presented. The method is applied on measurements of the total heat load for a single family house. It relies on the fact that the domestic hot water heating is a process generating short-lived spikes in the time series, while the space heating changes in slower patterns during the day dependent on the climate and user behavior. The challenge is to separate the domestic hot water heating spikes from the space heating without affecting the natural noise in the space heating measurements. The assumption behind the developed method is that the space heating can be estimated by a non-parametric kernel smoother, such that every value significantly above this kernel smoother estimate is identified as a domestic hot water heating spike. First, it is showed how a basic kernel smoothing approach is too simple to deliver reliable results. Therefore the problem is generalized to a local least squares problem, which makes it possible to design a robust kernel smoother, which estimate is not affected by the spikes. Furthermore, the generalized model makes it possible to estimate higher order local polynomials. Finally, the results are evaluated and it is found that the method is capable of calculating a reliable separation of the total heat load into the two components.},
